<h2>League of Legends</h2>
<p>League of Legends is a popular multiplayer online battle arena game where two teams (blue and red) face off with the goal of taking down the enemy Nexus. This project focuses on analyzing the early game strategies and their impact on the final outcome of the game.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>We use a dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, which contains the first 10 minutes stats of approximately 10,000 high ELO (DIAMOND I to MASTER) ranked games. The dataset includes 19 features per team (38 in total), such as kills, deaths, gold, experience, level, and more.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>There are many factors influencing the result of a game. We will analyze the importance of these factors in early-game(0-10 minutes of the game)</p>
